Case Study:
	I have three old hp monitors, not new. I want to sell it on my own website.
    That’s why I should create a product upload form on my website,
    then upload my product with specification and available quantity.
    My monitors have a 15.6 inch display. My monitor’s VGA cable status, yes,
    I will sell it for 8000 tk.
